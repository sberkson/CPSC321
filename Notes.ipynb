    "        * Manage access to DB components\n",
    "5. Relational DBMS (RDBMS/DBMS)\n",
    "    * Uses relational model to store data (tables of rows & columns)\n",
    "    * Typically uses SQL as the query language\n",

    "        * INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE...\n",
    "    * DQL = \"Data Query Language\"\n",
    "        * Otherwise known as SQL, used for search and selection of table data\n",
    "        * SELECT, WITH...\n",

    "9. Transactional Concurrency\n",
    "    * Lots of transactions happening simultaneously\n",
    "10. ACID propeties\n",
    "    * Atomicity - All or nothing, either complete the transaction or end it with no effects on the database\n",
    "    * Concistency - Transactions dont violate DB constraints\n",
    "    * Isolation - Two transactions dont impact each other, independent execution of transactions\n",
